# Perceived-Academic-Freedom-Among-U.S.-Academic-Librarians
In this project, I analyzed self-reported academic freedom among librarians. I cleansed the data and used  Logit Proportional-Odds model (Ordinal Logistic Regression) to model the effects of Gender, Sexual Orientation, Race and Age on self-reported academic freedom in R. 

The R file contains data cleansing, segmentation & standardization, regression analysis & stepwise variable selection, and data visualization (dplyr, ggplot). The PDF file contains the academic write-up that I submitted for my final Capstone project for my degree in Statistics at the University of Minnesota.
